This is what should be ac|com|plished by the one who is wise, Who seeks the good, and has ob|tained peace. 
Let one be stren|u|ous, up|right, and sin|cere, 
With|out pride, eas|i|ly con|tent|ed, and joy|ous. 
Let one not be sub|merged by the things of the world. Let one not take upon one|self the burden of riches. Let one's sens|es be con|trolled. 
Let one be wise but not puff|ed up and 
Let one not de|sire great pos|ses|sions even for one's  fam|i|ly. 
Let one do nothing that is mean or that the wise would reprove. 
May all be|ings be happy. May they be joy|ous and live in safe|ty, 
All living be|ings, whe|ther weak or strong, 
In high or mid|dle or low realms of exist|ence. 
Small or great, vis|ible or in|vis|ible, 
Near or far, born or to be born, 
May all be|ings be happy. 
Let no one de|ceive a|noth|er nor despise any be|ing in any state. 
Let none by anger or hatred wish harm to another. 
Even as a mo|ther at the risk of her life watch|es over and pro|tects her only child, So with a bound|less mind should one cher|ish all liv|ing things. 
Suf|fus|ing love over the entire world, 
Ab|ove, be|low, and all a|round, with|out limit, 
So let one cul|tiv|ate an in|fin|ite good will tow|ard the whole world. 
Stand|ing or walk|ing, sit|ting or ly|ing down, 
Dur|ing all one's wak|ing hours, 
Let one pract|ice the way with grat|i|tude.  
Not hold|ing to fixed views,
En|dowed with in|sight, freed from sense ap|pe|tites, 
One who ac|hieves the way 
Will be freed from the du|al|ity of birth and death.
