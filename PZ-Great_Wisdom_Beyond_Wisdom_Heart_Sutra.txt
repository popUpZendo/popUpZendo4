Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva,
when practicing deeply the Prajna Paramita,
perceived that all five skandhas are empty
and was saved from all suffering and distress.
“Shariputra, form does not differ from emptiness
emptiness does not differ from form
That which is form is emptiness
that which is emptiness form.
The same is true of feelings, perceptions, impulses, consciousness. Shariputra, all dharmas are marked with emptiness
they do not appear nor disappear
are not tainted nor pure
do not increase nor decrease.
Therefore in emptiness no form,
no feelings, perceptions, impulses, consciousness;
no eyes, no ears, no nose, no tongue, no body, no mind;
no color, no sound, no smell, no taste, no touch, no object of mind; no realm of eyes and so forth until no realm of mind-consciousness; no ignorance and also no extinction of it, and so forth until
no old age and death and also no extinction of them;
no suffering, no origination, no stopping, no path,
no cognition, also no attainment.
With nothing to attain
the Bodhisattva depends on Prajna Paramita
and mind is no hindrance.
Without any hindrance no fears exist.
Far apart from every inverted view, one dwells in Nirvana.
In the three worlds all Buddhas depend on Prajna Paramita
and attain unsurpassed, complete, perfect enlightenment.
Therefore know the Prajna Paramita
is the great transcendent mantra,
is the great bright mantra,
is the utmost mantra,
is the supreme mantra
which is able to relieve all suffering
and is true, not false.
So proclaim the Prajna Paramita mantra,
proclaim the mantra that says:
Gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate! Bodhi! Svaha!”
