Practical Zen is a peer-led discussion group that explores ways of integrating Zen practice into everyday life. We also deepen our understanding of Buddhist concepts such as: ego, attachment, duality, emptiness, and the formless, by putting them into the context of real, everyday life situations. Together, with a Zen priest, we examine the question of what Zen might mean in the midst of everyday life and design ways to bring the elements of practice alive in our daily activity.
